# Sample Of Work
This is a repository designed to show a sample of my coding work along my academic formation. Most of it has been done during the first semester of the master in Data Science (UB, 2017). You can find code in C, Python or R in a wide  variety of fields.

All the code of this repository is done totally by myself except for one [library](https://github.com/escapa12/sampleOfWork/blob/master/NumericalCalculus/rk78.c)  from the C project which implements a method for solving differential equations.

### Summary

#### C

* [Numerical calculus project](https://github.com/escapa12/sampleOfWork/tree/master/NumericalCalculus): we solve complicated differential equations in order to predict and redirect trajectories of space ships.  

#### Python
* [IMG compression and PCA](https://github.com/escapa12/sampleOfWork/tree/master/IMGcompression%26PCA): numerical algebra practice about image compression using singular value descomposition and implementation of PCA on big datasets.
* [Google Page Rank](https://github.com/escapa12/sampleOfWork/tree/master/GooglePageRank): numerical algebra practice where we replicate the original Page Rank used by Google at its birth. We just need good methods to compute eigenvalues.
* [Machine Learning - Kernels](https://github.com/escapa12/sampleOfWork/tree/master/Kernels): practice of ML where we experiment on the use of different Kernels for classification problems.

#### R
* [INLA](https://github.com/escapa12/sampleOfWork/tree/master/BayessianProject-%20INLA): Bayessian Statistics project about a method to fit a very general hieriarchical model without using MCMC.
